This is some machine learning note.  
Not finished yet  
It was written in google doc as a personal note. But it become inconvenient when the doc become longer. So I decided to re-organize it.  
I have not read all papers. I just drop a short note when I read it from related work or reference list. I hope I will have time to read it someday :P
