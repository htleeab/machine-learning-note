# GAN_for_Data_Augmentation
Current quality of GAN seems not really improve model...but it is a new area to be explored.
Just list some paper

[The Effectiveness of Data Augmentation in Image Classification using Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.04621)
Sadly, seems that GAN-based data augmentation is not better than tranditional data augmentation

## Person-reID GAN (ICCV 2017)
[Unlabeled Samples Generated by GAN Improve the Person Re-identification Baseline in vitro](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07717) 
### (label smoothing regularization for outliers) LSRO
use GAN generate new (negative) input, assigns a **uniform label distribution** to the unlabeled images, which regularizes the supervised model and improves the baseline.

## BAGAN
[BAGAN: Data Augmentation with Balancing GAN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09655.pdf)  
> The generative model learns useful features from majority classes and uses these to generate images for minority classes. We apply **class conditioning in the latent space** to drive the generation process towards a target class. The generator in the GAN is initialized with the encoder module of an **autoencoder** that enables us to learn an accurate class-conditioning in the latent space. 

## DeLiGAN (CVPR 2017)
[DeLiGAN : Generative Adversarial Networks for Diverse and Limited Data](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.02071.pdf)  
when data is limited yet originates from a diverse image modality, increasing the network depth becomes infeasible. 
* enhance intra-class diversity
> Instead of increasing the model depth, we propose to increase the modelling power of the **prior distribution**. In particular, we propose a **reparameterization of the latent space** as a **Mixtureof-Gaussians model**

## DG-Net (2019)
[Joint Discriminative and Generative Learning for Person Re-identification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.07223.pdf)
> In this paper, we seek to improve learned re-id embeddings by better leveraging the generated data. To this end, we propose a **joint learning framework that couples re-id learning and data generation end-to-end**. Our model involves a generative module that **separately encodes each person into an appearance code and a structure code**, and a discriminative module that **shares the appearance encoder** with the generative module. By switching the appearance or structure codes, the generative module is able to generate high-quality cross-id composed images, which are online fed back to the appearance encoder and used to improve the discriminative module.
