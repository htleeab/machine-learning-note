# GAN for Data Augmentation
Current quality of GAN seems not really improve model...but it is a new area to be explored.
Just list some paper

[The Effectiveness of Data Augmentation in Image Classification using Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.04621)
Sadly, seems that GAN-based data augmentation is not better than tranditional data augmentation

## Person-reID GAN (ICCV 2017)
[Unlabeled Samples Generated by GAN Improve the Person Re-identification Baseline in vitro](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07717) 
a semi-supervised pipeline that only uses the origianl training set
### (label smoothing regularization for outliers) LSRO
use GAN generate new input, assigns a uniform label distribution to the unlabeled images, which regularizes the supervised model and improves the baseline.

## BAGAN
[BAGAN: Data Augmentation with Balancing GAN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09655.pdf)  
> The generative model learns useful features from majority classes and uses these to generate images for minority classes. We apply *class conditioning in the latent space* to drive the generation process towards a target class. The generator in the GAN is initialized with the encoder module of an *autoencoder* that enables us to learn an accurate class-conditioning in the *latent space*.
