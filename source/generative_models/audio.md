> * We show that WaveNets can generate raw speech signals with subjective naturalness never before reported in the field of text-to-speech (TTS), as assessed by human raters.
> * In order to deal with long-range temporal dependencies needed for raw audio generation, we develop new architectures based on **dilated causal convolutions**, which exhibit very large receptive fields.
> * We show that when **conditioned on a speaker identity**, a single model can be used to **generate different voices**.
> * The same architecture shows strong results when tested on a small speech recognition dataset, and is promising when used to generate other audio modalities such as music

P.S.
> We observed that adding speakers resulted in better validation set performance compared to training solely on a single speaker. This suggests that WaveNetâ€™s internal representation was shared among multiple speakers
