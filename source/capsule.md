Currently, Capsule Net still could not scale up to real world problem because of hardware and software optimization. 
> The routing algorithm and the small matrix transformations can't really make use of the tricks people have developed to facilitate fast cnn networks, and so we can't train capsules networks of the same size as the state of the art models yet. This isn't a theoretical limitation, it's just a practical one, and one we believe we will be able to overcome.
