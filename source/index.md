# Vivian's machine learning note's

This notes breifly mark some paper to keep track of the development on some topic that I interested in and understand the main contribution of each paper. 
To be honest, for most of paper, I haven't read every sections of it. Some of paper haven't been read at all, just mark a link. Please correct me in git issue/pull request if I wrote something wrong.
