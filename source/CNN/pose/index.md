# Pose
* [Pose Estimation](pose.md)
* [Action Recognition](action.md)
* [Temporal Action Proposal Genration](temporal_proposal.md)
* [Motion Retargeting](motion_retargeting.md)
* [Human Image Synthesis](human_image_synthesis.md)

## Description
* [Pose Estimation](pose.md) - extract pose from image, prediction pose type with image as input

* [Action Recognition](action.md) - prediction action type with image sequence as input
* [Temporal Action Proposal Genration](temporal_proposal.md) - propose action with temporal booundaries with image sequence as input

* [Motion Retargeting](motion_retargeting.md) - Generate skeleton (pose) with condition
* [Human Image Synthesis](human_image_synthesis.md) - Generate image with conditional skeleton (from image directly or motion retargetion) and persion (from single image/image sequence)
