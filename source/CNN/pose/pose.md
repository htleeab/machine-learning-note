> Existing pose estimation approaches fall into two categories: single-stage and multi-stage methods. While multistage methods are seemingly more suited for the task, their performance in current practice is not as good as singlestage methods. This work studies this issue. We argue that the current multi-stage methodsâ€™ unsatisfactory performance comes from the insufficiency in various design choices. We propose several improvements, including the single-stage module design, cross stage feature aggregation, and coarse-tofine supervision.
