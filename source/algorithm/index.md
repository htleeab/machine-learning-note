## K-Nearest Neighbors,KNN
supervised learning
For classification:  
Given a test instance i, find the k closest neighbors and their labels  
Predict i’s label as the majority of the labels of the k nearest neighbors

For regression:  
Given a test instance i, find the k closest neighbors and their value  
Predict i’s value as the mean of the value of the k nearest neighbors

Could be used directly without training. "Training" process is building a index for searching neighbors faster.
### k
small k-> overfitting  
large k-> underfitting  
## K-Means
clustering
## Decision Tree
## Random Forest
## Naive Bayes
## Gradient Boosting
