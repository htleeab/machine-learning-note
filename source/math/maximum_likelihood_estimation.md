# Maxium Likelihood Estimation (MLE)
The Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) is a method of estimating the parameters of a model.
The central idea behind MLE is to select that parameters (Î¸) that make the observed data the most likely.
[A great note from David Varodayan](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs109/lectureNotes/LN21_parameters_mle.pdf) with practice of Bernoulli, Poisson, Normal
