# About Me
![](img/selfie2anime/2.jpg) from [Selfie2Anime](anime_face.html#selfie2anime)  
Vivian LEE, 李皓婷, a HKUST Computer Science graduate, living in Hong Kong. [INTP](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/INTP)- Like coding and love (trying to) understanding abstract logic/ idea.  
I addicts to internet, it is hard to put down the phone when walking and eating

## Why do I read papers?
I like to learning theory behind model. Simply running program without understanding make me confused and uncomfortable, and it will be frustrating to read the code and fix bug without basic understanding. I like to take some time to read/take a quick look the original paper (and papers its referenced) and understand why it working, so that I could having some initial idea of the result/ do it suitable for current task.  
Programing is also relaxing while the brain overwhelm with algorithm. Better do it both, reading papers when training new model or generating results.
