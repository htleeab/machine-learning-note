## Why do I read papers?
I like to learning theory behind model. Simply running program without understanding make me confused and uncomfortable, and it will be frustrating to read the code and fix bug without basic understanding. I like to take some time to read/take a quick look the original paper (and papers its referenced) and understand how it work, so that I could having some initial idea of the result/ know is it suitable for current task/ know how to fix issue.  
Programing is also relaxing while the brain overwhelm with algorithm. Better do it both, reading papers when training new model or generating results.
