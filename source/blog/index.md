# About Me
![](img/selfie2anime/2.jpg) from [Selfie2Anime](anime_face.html#selfie2anime)  
Vivian LEE, 李皓婷, a HKUST Computer Science graduate, living in Hong Kong. [INTP](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/INTP)- Like coding and love (trying to) understanding abstract logic/ idea.  
I addicts to internet, it is hard to put down the phone when walking and eating

## Why do I reading papers?
My job usually just ask for git clone research code and then modify code to run company assets or just test different alternative within short time without understanding. I do not like this style. I like to understand the concept and have some initial idea of the result, and then test if my thought is correct or not. I try to get some time to read the original paper when model training/inferencing or generating result. 
It doesn't mean I do not like coding. Programing is also relaxing while the brain overwhelm with algorithm, it just so confusing and uncomfortable when using running program that don’t understand, also frustrating to read the code without basic understanding.
