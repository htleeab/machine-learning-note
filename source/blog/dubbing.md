# Dubbing
Is it possible to encode the audio to 3 components (voice, tone, content) to build a model for dubbing (do no need to learn NLP, just input content as audio with machine voice)?
Need to read more paper related to audio...
might also add age, auto tune the voice for the same character with different ages
Applicatoin: translate TV series to other language(with exactly same voice and tone), dubbing by only 1 person (given voice feature, input tone and content)
